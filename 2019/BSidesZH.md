## 5G Security

With 5G CN (Core Network) moved to the cloud; http with REST API replacing SS7 -> increase in attack surface

## Scanning at hyperscale

Intelligent scheduling: 
* know what you are scanning (type of device, role in the network)
* know when it is ok to scan (eg. don't scan an SD-WAN controller when it's at high load)
* have a good process for exclusion and recovery
* leave IP behind -> asset driven scans

Problem: 1% of false positive is hundreds of findings at hyperscale
